<!-- Many years ago, The villagers of Grimnow lived happily. Things were peaceful. One day a dragon named Bolthdex appeared and destroyed a village. Along came a hero named Bob who was an expert bowman. Bob had a plan to making a wager with the dragon and kill the dragon while it sleeps. When Bob faced the dragon, he banished the dragon and rescued Grimnow. That day, the villagers learned the value of an expert bowman.
