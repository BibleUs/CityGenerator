This will be an import of an app I wrote several years ago. It needs a rewrite.

Sample output:

========== Lewismore ==========

Lewismore is a fairly normal population (with one monsterous race) of around 883.
Located near a river, this assimilated Village is ruled by the clergy,
although there is a recluse that quietly assists the leadership, 
while secretly a dragon in disguise.

Within the city and the surrounding areas, you'll find:
    * Thieves guild (secret)
    * chaotic Mages guild 
    * food trade 
    * a huge marsh

You arrive at the city around mid-day, where the air is thick,
the clouds are dark, the wind is dead, and the temp is nice.
There is thunder and lighting.

Upon arrival, you see:
    * preparations for war
    * a religious festival

Law enforcement is loose, punishments are mainly hard labor,
and convictions are sentenced by a magistrate.

Populations is broken down as follows:
    *   623   Lycanthropes ( 70.5%)
    *   143       Half-elf ( 16.1%)
    *    72            Elf (  8.1%)
    *    27     Gullydwarf (    3%)
    *    18       Half-orc (    2%)
