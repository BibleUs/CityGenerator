========== Gullhead Hold (718120)==========

Gullhead Hold is a fairly normal population (with one monsterous race) of around 3845.
Located near a river, this unified large town is ruled by a dictator,
although there is a recluse that quietly denounces the leadership, 
while secretly a angel in disguise.

Within the city and the surrounding areas, you'll find:
    * expensive magic items trade (secret)
    * slaves trade (secret)
    * rare food trade 
    * stolen art trade (secret)
    * a drainage ditch

You arrive at the city around dead of night, where the clouds are dark, the air is humid 
and the wind is breezy. It is misty.


Upon arrival, around 12 citizens are wandering the mild large town. You see:
    * a victory celebration
    * the aftermath of a raid

Law enforcement can be bribed, punishments are mainly eye for an eye,
and convictions are sentenced by a magistrate.
